<h1>Web-Based GIS: Doing More With Google Maps [1]</h1>

<h2>A recap of earlier work</h2>

<p>In the first lecture on GoogleMaps, we started by looking at the history and
general features of Google Maps.The service was introduced in 2005, and has
grown rapidly in popularity since then. The basic map data, and the framework
for placing markers on the maps, use a Mercator projection, based on the WGS84
datum, the same datum used by many applications with a worldwide scope,
including the Global Positioning System. GoogleMaps supports a number of map
views, including Map (the default view) view, Satellite view, Terrain view,
Street view and Traffic view. Traffic view is a derivative of the default Map
view, in which a number of major roads have their shading and line-style varied
according to real-time traffic flow data. Street view is also derived from Map
view: in selected cities some streets are highlighted - indicating that street
view data are available - and clicking on such a street leads to a pop-up
window being created that shows an eye-level view at that point, which is
pan-able through 360°.</p>

<h3 class="post_float">Generating bespoke maps </h3>

<p>There are a number of ways of generating bespoke maps using Google Maps. A
simple approach is to create a URL that calls a GoogleMaps server and includes
a parameter that sets the map centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also possible to give a map a URL
as a parameter. If that URL references a file containing KML format marker
data, then those markers will be drawn on the map created by Google Maps. Both
these approaches are fairly quick and easy, but are of limited use, although
they may be an acceptable solution for illustrating the location of something
in an ad hoc fashion, especially if one does not have access to a web server on
which one can create and make available files. <br>
</p>

<p>A far more powerful and flexible way of creating bespoke maps is to use the
GoogleMaps API. Google Maps is based around a Javascript interface that draws
map data from a server, and presents it on screen with various control
functions. By using the API, you can extend the Javascript map interface in
many ways, adding your own data as overlays and modifying the appearance of the
map.<br>

Blue Plaques in Leeds using Google Maps</div>

<p>In the second lecture, we looked at ways of extending the basic map in order
to be able to present more useful information. This was demonstrated by adding
some simple markers to the map, with pop-up information windows. At the same
time, the growing size of the html page associated with this led to a need to
clean up the code, and to separate out elements on a functional basis:
individual files were created and used to contain the basic html code, the map
loading logic, and a data file.<br>
</p>

<p>The practical session associated with the second lecture focussed on a more
substantive task: creating a map with a set of markers, and with pop-up
information linked to each marker. The markers related to the locations of Blue
Plaques in and around central Leeds. The task presented two major problems that
are characteristic of similar real-world tasks: first, extracting the data from
a spreadsheet in a usable format, and second, converting the co-ordinate data
into the required format. <br>
</p>

<p>The resulting page should have looked something like the shown in Figure 1,
although it is possible to have included much richer background information,
and to have presented the map in a more appealing manner.</p>
