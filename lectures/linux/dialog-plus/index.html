title: Linux - Dialog-Plus

<h1>Linux: Dialog-Plus</h1>

<p>The server we shall use for this part of the course is <KBD>dialogplus.leeds.ac.uk</KBD>. 
This can be accessed using PuTTY software or similar applications. PuTTY allows you to interact 
with a remote computer via a command prompt. A copy of PuTTY can be downloaded from 
<a href = 'http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/'>here</a> if you do not have a copy. It doesn't need installing; you can 
just run it by double-clicking it.</p> 

<p>In this task you are required to:
<ul>
	<li>Connect to dialogplus using the PuTTY software</li>
	<li>Check your personal directory on the web server</li>
	<li>Check which version of Apache dialogplus is running</li>
</ul></p>

<ol>
	<li>Open PuTTY now and connect to the dialogplus server using your log on credentials. 
		In the box marked 'Host Name (or IP address)' you should type 'dialogplus.leeds.ac.uk', 
		and for Connection type, select 'SSH', the port is 22. </li>

	<li>Click <KBD>open</KBD> and you will be prompted for your username and password. 
		As the Dialogplus server is running Linux, you can navigate your directories with Linux commands 
		(cd, ls)</li> 

	<li>List the contents of your current directory and you should see a directory called <KBD>web</KBD> 
		Any files you place in this directory will be available at dialogplus.leeds.ac.uk/geog5870/USERNAME 
		where username is the username you have been provided with for Dialogplus.</li> 

	<li>Use the '<KBD>httpd -v</KBD>' command to check which version of Apache is running.</li> 
	
	<li>Use <code>exit</code> to exit PuTTY and close the connection.</li>
</ol>
