Web GIS is about building, displaying and interacting with
online maps.

## Course Overview

The course is composed of 4 intensive days of lectures, practicals
and writing your own code. The first two-day block is based
on Google Maps and its Application Programming Interface (API).
The second block teaches open source
GIS tools (OSGEO) for serving maps online.

We provide [example data](/webGIS/data.html) and code snippets to guide you
through the [practicals](/webGIS/practicals.html). At the end of this process
you will be able to create a simple web mapping application on a topic of your
choice.
